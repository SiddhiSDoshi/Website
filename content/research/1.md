##### Abstract

This paper studies how solar generation affects electricity reliability in India through its effects on non-solar generation. Conventional wisdom suggests that solar generation reduces emissions by displacing fossil fuels, but potentially undermines electricity reliability due to its variability. Using plausibly exogenous variation in solar irradiance, I find that while this holds true in the US where solar replaces fossil fuel generation one-for-one, in India, solar generation instead leads to an energy expansion, easing shortages that cause power outages. Solar does not contemporaneously displace non-solar generation one-for-one in India and solar generation over a given past week increases current non-solar generation, increasing total generation. This result is driven by the accumulation of coal stocks at powerplants in India, where coal shortages drive power outages. When solar meets a greater share of demand, powerplants need less coal, allowing residual stocks to build up. These stocks are then drawn down in subsequent days to increase generation. This increase in electricity supply improves reliability: I apply machine learning techniques to predict outages using daily night lights data and find that solar generation reduces the share of pixels under outage. Hence, solar delivers a low-carbon energy expansion and improves reliability in India, but does not necessarily cut emissions, since fossil fuels are not displaced.
