##### Abstract

Conventional wisdom suggests that solar generation reduces emissions by displacing fossil fuels but, because of its variability, might undermine electricity reliability. Using plausibly exogenous spatial and temporal variation in solar irradiance, I find that while this holds for the US, where solar replaces fossil fuel generation one-for-one, in India, solar generation instead expands energy supply, easing shortages that cause power outages. Solar does not contemporaneously displace nonsolar generation one-for-one in India, and solar generation over a given past week increases current nonsolar generation and, in turn, total generation. This result is driven by the accumulation of coal stocks at power plants in India, where coal shortages drive power outages. When solar fulfills a greater share of demand, power plants need less coal, which allows residual stocks to build up. These stocks are drawn down in subsequent days to increase generation, improving reliability. I apply machine learning techniques to predict outages using daily night-time lights data and find that solar generation reduces the share of pixels under outage. Hence, solar delivers a low-carbon energy expansion and improves reliability in India but does not necessarily cut emissions from existing fossil fuel sources.
