##### Abstract
Carbon credits are widely used to meet emissions obligations under cap-and-trade programs and corporate environmental, social, and governance compliance. However, recent studies show that carbon credits are often inframarginal and do not result in ``additional emission reductions''. This study focuses on agricultural carbon credits, which have been growing in popularity. In an ongoing field-experiment with Kyle Emerick and Mai Mahmoud, we use a randomized evaluation to study whether agricultural carbon credits generate emission reductions and their effects on farming practices and beliefs.
